            <h1>Web Apps and Databases</h1>
            <h2>What are Web Applications</h2>
                <p>
                    In the most simplest terms, a web application is a program that is used without having to download the program onto your system. <br>
                    Usually, a user would have to install an application or program onto their system in order to use it effectively; however, a web app <br>
                    allows for a user to run the software directly from the web using a browser. But what the benefits are for a web app vs traditional apps.<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Platform Independence</li>
                            <p>With a web app, we don't have to account for all the various different platforms/OS's as the software is compatible to the browser vs the host machine</p>
                        <li>One universal Update</li>
                            <p>Rather than having to update all unique hosts that have the software installed, we update the servers that run the software. This allows for quick fixes.</p>
                        <li>Accessibility</li>
                            <p>Easily accessible in that any device that has access to a browser will also have access to the web app software.</p>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compared to traditional web sites. Web Apps do more than just provide information to the user. The most important feature is that they are interactive.<br>
                    Most web apps are comprised of the following: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Database: Stores and retrieves necessary information</li>
                        <li>Web Server: handles requests coming from the client</li>
                        <li>Application Server: Completes the requested task</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            <h2>How Web Applications work with Databases</h2>
                <p>
                    As stated earlier, the web application handles the client request. Once a request is made by the user from their system,<br>
                    the database will either retrieve whatever information is queried or store the information entered by the user.

            <h2>Intranet vs Internet</h2>
                <p>
                    Though there are a lot of similarities between internet networks and intranet networks <br>
                    Internet networks are global networks that allow any user to access their site. <br>
                    Although both leverage the internet protocols and world wide web standards, intranets are <br>
                    private networks that limit access to only certain individuals or groups. The intent is for <br>
                    them to be private from the global or everyday users.
